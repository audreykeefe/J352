<p>The first iPhone was released to the public in 2007 and created a public storm. Everyone was interested in getting their hands on the new and exciting touch screen. Years have passed and the iPhone still dominates the electronics field with the newly released iPhone 15. This timeline portrays the first 7 iphone generations and then changes that occur over a decade. iPhones grew from an interesting conecpt to a must have device in only a few years. The public following is still abundant today and is one of the reasons I was drawn to make this timeline. </p>
