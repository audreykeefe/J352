<h4>By Audrey Keefe</h4><h4>December 6, 2023.</h4>
<br>
<p>University of Maryland’s larceny-theft rates have been driven down due to UMPD's increased
community involvement, resources and partnerships.</p>

<p>In 2012, 362 larceny thefts were reported by the UMD’s Uniform Crime Report. This number
fell to 202 in 2022, demonstrating a decrease of 44.20%. The numbers have scattered over the
past ten years, but this overall decrease can be attributed to an increase in UMPD’s community
involvement.</p>

<p>University of Maryland is a target-rich environment with 40,000+ students and 14,000+ faculty
and staff. UMD is also a public university with an open campus, which allows more
opportunities for crime to occur.</p>

<p>UMPD’s community partnerships have been the key to their success in lowering larceny rates.
They have expanded their on-campus presence and supplemented it with friendly attitudes.
According to the UMD Office of Community Engagement, “500+ Annual community-university
connections made,” the website showed.</p>

<p>UMPD works with businesses and facilities on and off campus to halt the opportunities for
larceny, assault, and other crimes to occur. Partnerships help people become more informed
about how they can prevent crime from happening. It also helps relations with police forces
flourish on and off campus.</p>

<p>More recently, UMPD’s Information Analysis Unit has reported a total of 311 larceny thefts from
January to November 2023. This staggering number includes theft from buildings, motor
vehicles, and all other larceny.</p>

<p>In September 2021, President Darryll Pines established a Community Policing Task Force that
would help examine attitudes towards police, and ways to further public safety and extinguish
hate bias and racial profiling. This behind-the-scenes team consisted of 28 professors and chairs
involved with campus from different backgrounds and perspectives.</p>

<p>As of September 2023, there have been 11 completed actions, 10 in progress, and 21
recommendations as of September 2023. Those that have been completed include the public reporting of agreements and contracts between UMD and police departments and a review of the
notification system for on- and off-campus incidents.</p>

<p>September 2023 held the highest number of theft-larceny crimes with 51 total. This can likely be
attributed to the beginning of a new school year with a larger number of new students and events
on campus.</p>

<p>The notification system alerts members of the UMD community when a crime has happened,
which are typically off-campus incidents outside of UMPD’s jurisdiction in non-residential areas.
The most common are off-campus robberies with a weapon or burglaries with no weapon. As for
on-campus incidents, the most common is indecent exposures, the Diamondback reported had
“nearly tripled” from 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>While UMPD is aware of this issue, community involvement cannot be the only measure taken
to halt these crimes. UMPD provides readers with expansive resources for walking escorts,
incident report services, the counseling center, police departments, and more.</p>

<p>UMPD’s usage of partnerships and community involvement in College Park, as well as the
resources available, has greatly improved over the last decade and is helping reduce crime rates.
Another method of campus outreach was Teddy, a campus comfort dog, who joined the force in
2021.</p>

<p>The chocolate Labrador, known as Teddy The Terp, helps officers further their ties to the
community. Teddy is a comfort K-9 and serves as UMPD’s campus ambassador. Teddy and his
handler, Melissa Fischer, are extremely active on campus and love to connect with students and
officers.</p>

<p>Community engagement is vital for officers to do their job to the fullest extent. Due to the
UMPD’s increased campus involvement over the years, there has been a 44.20% decrease in
larceny-theft from 2012 to 2022.</p>

<p>UMPD’s partnership with businesses and facilities has also improved along with resources for
reporting crimes over the past 10 years. As the University of Maryland ages, the reporting
methods, resources and community involvement stay updated. UMPD is always looking to increase involvement, which is why they are becoming increasingly
successful in their crime prevention.</p>
