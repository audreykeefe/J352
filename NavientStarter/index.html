<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>I analyzed data from Navient in Rhode Island about student loan issues from 11/13/20 to 11/13/23. I found that 81.03% of the complaints were about federal loans and 18.97% were regarding private student loans. This made sense to me because federal student loans are generally the more popular option when compared to private student loans.</p>

<p>Another interesting gap I found in the data was how 44 out of the 59 cases explained that the issue was “dealing with the lender or services.” Within this small data set, even that number is disparaging and makes me wonder if many of these issues that are being filed across the board are based on problems with the company instead of the loan itself. Among this main issue, I also found that the second largest issue, with only 5 cases, was the “problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem.” This issue being the second most prevalent further proves my point that many of the issues coming into the company are not particularly about the loan itself, but the company’s existing problems with lack of investigation and skills with customers.</p>

<p>I also overviewed the sub-issues in each case to take a look at the deeper issues of the cases stretching over three years. I found that the most popular issue with 17 cases was “trouble with how payments are being handled.” The second most prevalent issue was “received bad information about your loan” which leads me to believe that there is an issue with misleading consumers in the loan process so the companies can gain better benefits. This hypothesis can be better explored by looking at data from all around the country from different companies and types of loans. This would help explore if consumers are being purposely misled or if it just happens in the process sometimes. The third most prevalent issue was the “problem with customer service” which further proves my point from above that the company needs to look deeper at how their consumers are handled when they have issues with their loans. This can make or break someone's experience and if it is tackled, can lead to a lot less cases being filed away.</p>
